Game's core is done, aside from a few relatively minor tweaks all the logic is already implemented and a framework exists to easily add more content

'Major' goals:
    Implement optional locked chests, doors, and keys:
        add a generic key feature, all optional chests and doors use these generic keys
        every floor is guaranteed to have at least one key that you can access without another key
        there is no such restriction on chests and locked rooms
        this makes keys a more interesting resource. what will you use your key on? this locked temple door, or the golden chest?
    Implement into Feature a method that is called when the player enters the room:
        this is particularly designed for enemies, so that they can attack the player when they enter the room
        it can be reused for certain other features as well, should it become necessary
    Implement into the parser the ability to look at the player for action prompts:
        this doesn't currently exist because the status command gives the player everything they really need to know
        player's inventory should always be checked after the room's children
        player can specify they want their inventory to be checked first with the use of "my" or "player's" or "self" in their input
    Refactor AccessoryEffects into all equipment:
        allows non-accessory equipment to grant effects
        will require rewriting of equipment json template

'Minor' goals:
    Add more enemies, themes, features, etc.:
    Add more room templates:
        statue rooms:
            has a statue of a god, will ask something of the player
