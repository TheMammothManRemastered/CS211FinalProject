this is just ideas for special rooms and features

needed every floor:
    boss/exit room
    miniboss/key room
    treasure room

everything else:
    statue of a god or mythological feature:
        locked room
        big statue of a god inside with a plaque at the base
        the plaque reads off some challenge
            leave no stone unturned (a rock spawns somewhere in the floor and you have to examine it to pass the trial)
            bathe in the blood of the hated foe (kill every humanoid on the floor, don't let any run away)
            brave the voyage of Odysseus (a model ship in a bottle spawns somewhere on the floor, a relief of an island with a city is on the floor of another. bring the ship to the city)
        do the challenge, you get some reward related to the task or god
            blessing of athena (minor buff to all stats?)
            crusher of skulls (stupidly large mace, high base damage, bonus damage against humanoids, lower speed bc it's heavy)
            blessing of poseidon (small evasion chance, extra damage on odd numbered turns)
    penance room:
        room with an altar and a knife
        if you try to pick up the knife, a voice intones that a sacrifice must be paid and you lose some health
        the knife vanishes and you gain a random stat buff
    daedalus' workshop:
        a workshop filled with in-progress things
        contains loot
        if you're in the labyrinth, it contains a blueprint of the entire floor
    futuristic room:
        always locked
        chronos' influence is strong in this room, stuff from the future and the past is here
        there's a coffee maker, some japanese yen, a half-assembled ikea cabinet
        cave paintings on the wall, a dead dinosaur
        chance for some sort of future equipment on a table
            an energy sword of some sort (negates armor, high damage)
            a laser gun (chance for a critical hit, always goes first)
            powered exosuit (lots of health up, gives you an energy shield ability (only so many times per battle, gives 95% damage absorption, lowers speed drastically, stuns the enemy if they use a melee attack on you while it's active, only lasts for a couple turns or until an enemy hits you)
